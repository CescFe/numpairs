# NumPairs

NumPairs is a native Android puzzle game inspired by arithmetic grid challenges.

The project is being built iteratively, starting with a small playable prototype and expanding later with stronger gameplay rules, better presentation, and more game modes.

## Current Status

### Version: v0 - Playable Prototype

Completed: [prd-v0.md](./docs/product/prd/prd-v0.md)

### Active milestone: v1 - Product Polish & Technical Hardening

Current implementation baseline: [prd-v1.md](./docs/product/prd/prd-v1.md)

---

## Tech Stack

- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- Gradle Kotlin DSL
- Android Studio

---

## Domain Modeling

The puzzle core uses a small domain layer guided by the project's ubiquitous language and DDD-inspired modeling.

Current core concepts:

- `Puzzle`
- `Board`
- `Tile`
- `Expression`
- `Operator`
- `Strip`

```

Current responsibilities are split as follows:

- `data/puzzle/seed`: bootstrap puzzle data used by the current prototype.
- `domain/puzzle`: puzzle rules, validation, assignments, and core domain types.
- `feature/game`: the Game feature entry point plus its `presentation` and `ui` subpackages.
- `feature/game/ui/components`: Game-specific Compose building blocks such as tiles and chips.
- `ui/navigation` and `ui/theme`: app-level navigation wiring and shared theming.

The test source sets still keep the existing physical `ui/screen` folders for Game-related tests, even though the production code has already been reorganized under `feature/game`.
