# NumPairs

NumPairs is a native Android puzzle game inspired by arithmetic grid challenges.

The project is being built iteratively, starting with a small playable prototype and expanding later with stronger gameplay rules, better presentation, and more game modes.

## Domain Modeling

The puzzle core uses a small domain layer guided by the project's ubiquitous language and DDD-inspired modeling.

Current core concepts:

- `Puzzle`
- `Board`
- `Tile`
- `Expression`
- `Operator`
- `Strip`

Current responsibilities are split as follows:

- `data/puzzle/seed`: handcrafted puzzle data currently used by Tutorial and ready to be replaced by authored tutorial content.
- `domain/puzzle`: puzzle rules, validation, assignments, and core domain types.
- `domain/fourpairs`: generated `4 Pairs` rules, generation, and validation-facing domain models.
- `feature/fourpairs`: generated `4 Pairs` route and puzzle provider wiring.
- `feature/game`: reusable Game feature entry point plus its `presentation` and `ui` subpackages.
- `feature/game/ui/components`: Game-specific Compose building blocks such as tiles and chips.
- `feature/menu`: menu entry point for selecting Tutorial or generated `4 Pairs`.
- `ui/navigation` and `ui/theme`: app-level navigation wiring and shared theming.
