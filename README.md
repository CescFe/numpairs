# NumPairs

NumPairs is a native Android arithmetic deduction puzzle.

Players complete hidden expressions on a board by using numbers from a strip. The project is built iteratively through documented product milestones.

## Current Status

### Active product planning: v6 - Guided First Run

Current milestone planning is documented in 🎓 [PRD v6 Guided First Run](./docs/product/prd/prd-v6.md).

### Implemented baseline: v5 - Shared Generated Modes

Historical snapshots:
- 🔧 [PRD v0 Playable Prototype](./docs/product/prd/prd-v0.md)
- ✨ [PRD v1 Product Polish & Technical Hardening](./docs/product/prd/prd-v1.md)
- 🧩 [PRD v2 Puzzle Generation & Replay Loop](./docs/product/prd/prd-v2.md)
- 🎓 [PRD v3 Guided Play & Rules Onboarding](./docs/product/prd/prd-v3.md)
- 🎨 [PRD v4 Visual Design System & UI Refinement](./docs/product/prd/prd-v4.md)
- 🧠 [PRD v5 Bigger Challenges with 8 Pairs](./docs/product/prd/prd-v5.md)

The PRDs are historical planning snapshots. Current generated-mode and profile behavior is documented in [puzzle-generation.md](./docs/product/puzzle-generation.md).

Both built-in generated profiles are implemented: `4 Pairs Low` and `8 Pairs Medium`.

## Domain Modeling

The puzzle core uses a small domain layer guided by the project's ubiquitous language and DDD-inspired modeling.

Current core concepts:

- `Puzzle`
- `Board`
- `Tile`
- `Expression`
- `Operator`
- `Strip`

Core responsibilities:

- `domain`: puzzle model, rules, validation, assignments, and generated puzzle logic.
- `feature`: Menu, Tutorial, generated modes, and reusable Game screen behavior.
- `data`: seed puzzle and persistence-backed preferences.
- `ui`: app navigation, theme, and shared visual defaults.
